# The EEVengers Oscilliscope Project
Four Channel 1GSPS Oscilliscope using USB 3 Gen 2 (10Gbps) to stream data to PC for processing and display.

## System Architecture

The input impedance of an oscilloscope should be 1MΩ in parallel with a small capacitance, around 15pF. The input stage provides this while attenuating the signal when necessary and amplifying it to drive the next stage. This is where the finer gain control comes in, the programmable gain amplifier (PGA) provides digitally controllable gain and filtering. It is also where an offset cancellation DAC feeds a copy of the measured DC offset into the non-inverting terminal of the PGA, cancelling the DC offset generated by the preamp. Then 4 of these channels are connected to a 4:1 adapter, bringing their differential outputs to the ADC and providing more outputs for the input relay control signals. The ADC converts the input signal to digital at a rate determined by the input clock. Currently, the clock will be provided externally until the PLL is designed and fitted on the ADC board. The high-speed digital outputs are converted by the FPGA from 8 serial data pairs and 2 clocking pairs to a 32-bit parallel interface used by the USB3 controller IC. This IC then transfers the ADC data over to the PC for processing and display. This topology decreases the BOM cost of an oscilloscope and enables the use of the PC’s RAM for gigapoints of sample memory, which is almost two orders of magnitude better than other low-cost oscilloscopes.
